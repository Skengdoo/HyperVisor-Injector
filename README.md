## Questions ?
- Q: does it work for all games | A: yes this does works for all games

## purpose of release ?
i dont have a lot of time since im very busy, another reason being i want to give everyone a chance to step into the internal cheating field and let people have the ability to inject into many anti-cheat protected games without worry.
